.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm mcc
is a machine code compiler.
It reads ASCII text '0' and '1' mapping to machine code instructions.
All other characters are ignored except the comment token ';'.
Comments begin with ';' and continue until EOL.
.Pp
Use the
.Fl o
option to specify the output filename.
The default is to put the executable in \fIa.out\fR.
.Pp
Supports little-endian x86-64 and i386 execution environments using the
System V application binary interface. 64-bit is the default mode,
32-bit mode is specified with the
.Fl 3
option.
.Pp
When writing to the .bss section, specify the size of memory reserved
using the
.Fl m
option.
If the size is zero (default), no .bss section will be written for the
executable.
.Pp
In 64-bit mode the .bss and .text sections start at 0x402000 and
0x401000 respectively, and in 32-bit mode 0x804a000 and 0x8049000
respectively.
Use the
.Fl b
and
.Fl t
options to specify custom addresses.
.Pp
Program header segment alignment is set to 0x1000 (the page size on most
systems).
.Pp
 .bss is aligned to a 16-byte constraint and .text to an 8-byte
constraint.
.Pp
Use the
.Fl s
option to mark the .text section as writable, allowing self-modifying code.
