Reads machine code text and produces i386 ELF executables.

Accepts ASCII text '0' and '1'. All other characters are ignored except the
comment token ';'. Comments begin with ';' and continue until EOL.

Only uses the .bss and .text sections, starting at 0x804a000 and 0x8049000
respectively. Page size is set to 0x1000 (4096). .bss is aligned to a 16-byte
constraint and .text to an 8-byte constraint.

Currently may only work with the Linux kernel.
