Reads machine code text and produces x86-64 or i386 Linux-compatible ELF
executables.

Accepts ASCII text '0' and '1'. All other characters are ignored except the
comment token ';'. Comments begin with ';' and continue until EOL.

Programmer's manual:
	In 64-bit mode .bss and .text start at 0x402000 and 0x401000
	respectively, and in 32-bit mode 0x804a000 and 0x8049000 respectively.

	Program header segment alignment is set to 0x1000 (page size on most
	systems).

	.bss is aligned to a 16-byte constraint and .text to an 8-byte
	constraint.

	If memsize is zero no .bss section will be written for the executable.
