Reads machine code text and produces i386 ELF executables.

Accepts ASCII text '0' and '1'. All other characters are ignored except the
comment token ';'. Comments begin with ';' and continue until EOL.

Only uses the .bss and .text sections, starting at 0x804a000 and 0x8049000
respectively. Page size is set to 0x1000 (4096).

Currently has occasional bugs. It uses a lot of magic values, and may only work
with the Linux kernel.
