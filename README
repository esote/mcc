NAME
	mcc - machine code compiler

SYNOPSIS
	mcc [-3s] [-m memsize] [-o file] file

DESCRIPTION
	mcc is a machine code compiler. It reads ASCII text '0' and '1' mapping
	to machine code instructions. All other characters are ignored except
	the comment token ';'. Comments begin with ';' and continue until EOL.

	Use the -o option to specify the output filename. The default is to put
	the executable in a.out.

	Supports little-endian x86-64 and i386 execution environments using the
	System V application binary interface. 64-bit is the default mode,
	32-bit mode is specified with the -3 option.

	When writing to the .bss section, specify the size of memory reserved
	using the -m option. If the size is zero (default), no .bss section will
	be written for the executable.

	In 64-bit mode the .bss and .text sections start at 0x402000 and
	0x401000 respectively, and in 32-bit mode 0x804a000 and 0x8049000
	respectively. Program header segment alignment is set to 0x1000 (the
	page size on most systems).

	.bss is aligned to a 16-byte constraint and .text to an 8-byte
	constraint.

	Use the -s option to mark the .text section as writable, allowing
	self-modifying code.
